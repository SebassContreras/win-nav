# specloop: loop-setup

You are configuring the loop **inside the target repo**. This is a one-time,
deliberately-invoked step — do not run it as a side effect of any other
specloop skill. There is nothing to install or link: `specloop:loop` reads
`.specloop/loop.config.json` directly, in whatever chat session runs it.

## Phase 0 — Read existing state

Read `.specloop/loop.config.json` if it exists — `specloop:start` writes it
during bootstrap. Anything already answered there is not re-asked; anything
left `"TBD"` is.

**Do not refuse on an empty `tasks.md`.** Configuring the loop is not
execution: nothing here runs a task, and `specloop:loop` already reports
cleanly when there's nothing to do. Gating configuration on a populated
`tasks.md` blocks a freshly-scaffolded repo from ever being set up. Report
the backlog state in Phase 2 instead.

**Check for an all-`human` backlog before Phase 1.** Look at the specs
`specloop:loop` would actually consider next: `planning/roadmap.md` rows with
status `todo`/`in_progress` whose dependencies are satisfied, or already
`in_progress`. Read each one's `tasks.md`. If every task in all of them is
`[human]` — no `[agent]` task is currently runnable anywhere — say so plainly
before asking the worker-CLI question: a worker CLI has nothing to run yet,
so setup would configure a loop that never fires this round. Ask whether to
continue anyway (e.g. to have it ready for when an agent task becomes
eligible, such as once a dependency clears) or stop here. This is common for
a project whose current spec is mostly human-owned work (research, approvals,
physical steps) — not a bug, just worth naming before walking through a Q&A
whose answer won't be exercised yet.

## Phase 1 — Guided config Q&A (only what's missing)

Ask, one at a time, waiting for each reply:

1. **Worker CLI** — "Which CLI(s) might ever run this loop — `claude`,
   `codex`, `opencode`, `copilot`, `cursor-agent`, `agy`, or another command
   on PATH? List every one you might use, even from a different machine or
   harness later — the loop always
   picks whichever entry matches the session actually running it, never
   splits work across the others." → `workers`, an array of `{ "cli": "...",
   "args": [...] }`. More than one entry is for portability (a different
   session, under a different harness, finds its own matching entry) and as
   an explicit fallback list the loop can ask the user, mid-run, to switch
   into if the matched one looks like it hit a usage/rate limit — never a
   round-robin split within one run. The worker always runs headlessly (no
   TTY, stdin
   closed) — a CLI invoked without its non-interactive flag will hang. **Never
   ask the user for a known CLI's headless flag — it's a fixed fact of that
   CLI, not a preference.** Use this map (each value is the whole `args` array):
   `claude` → `["-p"]`, `codex` → `["exec"]`, `opencode` → `["run"]`,
   `copilot` → `["--allow-all-tools", "-p"]`, `cursor-agent` →
   `["--trust", "--force", "-p"]`, `agy` → `["--add-dir", "{repoRoot}", "--mode",
   "accept-edits", "-p"]`. For `agy`, write `{repoRoot}` literally: `specloop:loop`
   replaces it with the repo's absolute path when it launches the worker, so the entry
   carries over to any checkout. `agy` needs it — a relative `--add-dir` doesn't work,
   and without `--add-dir` its headless mode loads no project skills. Say plainly, once, that `copilot` and `cursor-agent` need
   those flags to run headless and that they let the worker write files and run
   commands without asking. Say also that `agy` needs setup: its headless mode
   auto-denies shell commands (exit 0, nothing written — a plain create-a-file task
   failed that way, and a sub-agent died at its first denied command), and it works
   only once the user adds allow rules in `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/settings.json`,
   e.g. `{"permissions": {"allow": ["command(regex:Get-ChildItem.*)"]}}` (a plain
   `command(<text>)` must match the whole command; `regex:` matches a prefix). The user
   picks which commands to allow — never write those rules for them.
   `--dangerously-skip-permissions` let the agent read outside the repo in the audit —
   never add it for the user. Suggest an `agy` entry only if they will run the loop
   from an `agy` session. Only ask "what's its headless/non-interactive flag?"
   for a CLI not in that map. Mention this once, plainly: `specloop:loop`
   always uses whichever entry's provider matches the session running it,
   and prefers that harness's own native sub-agent mechanism over this CLI
   when one's available — the `args` given here matter when the harness has
   no native mechanism, or when the user explicitly asks to fall back to a
   different configured provider (e.g. on a suspected usage limit).
2. Default `logDir` to `.specloop/logs` unless the user wants something else.
3. **Context files** — confirm `contextFiles` lists the files a worker must
   read before working (default `["AGENTS.md", "planning/architecture.md", "planning/styles.md"]`;
   non-existent entries are skipped at run time). If any configured `workers[].cli` is not
   `claude`, say plainly that `AGENTS.md` is the only context that CLI auto-loads, so
   this list is how it learns the project's stack and conventions.

## Phase 2 — Write config, report backlog state

1. Write or update `.specloop/loop.config.json` from the Phase 1 answers, preserving
   anything `specloop:start` already wrote:
   ```json
   {
     "workers": [
       { "cli": "<answer>", "args": ["<headless flags, from the map above>"] }
     ],
     "logDir": ".specloop/logs",
     "contextFiles": ["AGENTS.md", "planning/architecture.md", "planning/styles.md"],
     "language": "<preserve if already set by specloop:start>"
   }
   ```
   A single-worker config also works written as the legacy `"workerCli"`/`"workerArgs"`
   shape, but write the `workers` array form here going forward. **Never drop an
   existing `"language"` field** when rewriting this file — this skill doesn't ask
   about it (that's `specloop:start`'s Phase 5), it only must not silently erase it.
2. Verify `.specloop/.gitignore` exists and reads `logs/*` + `!logs/.gitkeep`
   (`specloop:start` writes it) — create it if the repo was scaffolded before
   that existed, or fix it if it's the older bare `logs/` line (which also
   ignores `logs/.gitkeep` itself, defeating it — `planning/fix/006`).
3. Tell the user setup is done: `specloop:loop`, run in a chat session, is the
   way to actually work the backlog whenever they choose to.

Then report what the loop would actually find: if no spec has agent-runnable tasks
yet, say so and name the next step (`specloop:advance`, which drafts any missing
requirements, then closes design and tasks per spec in one go — or `specloop:design-closing` then
`specloop:task-breakdown` directly, on a named spec). If some specs have only
`human` tasks, name them — the loop will skip those.

**Do not invoke `specloop:loop` automatically.**

## Style rules

- Terse and structural, no filler prose.
- Never guess `workers` — always ask; explicitly user-configurable.
