# Interview question bank

Drawn from by `specloop:start` (and re-checked by `specloop:design-closing`). This file
is the source of interview *coverage*, not a script to read aloud: ask one question at a
time, in the user's own vocabulary, skipping what the conversation has already answered.
The opening request that triggered the skill is context, not an answer: it seeds
`idea-detail`, but never closes `project-type` or `goal` on its own.

**A dimension is "covered" when the user has actually answered it, "skipped" when they
declined it (record the reason), and "open" otherwise.** Every dimension below must end
in one of those three states in `.specloop/interview.md` before a phase may terminate.
Never infer an answer to close a dimension. (The one sanctioned derivation is
`specloop:advance`'s Phase 0.5: a spec's requirements drafted from the finished
interview plus web-verified industry standards, shown to the user for
yes/changes/defer.)

---

## Phase A — Type & vision (all project types)

| Dimension | Questions |
|---|---|
| `idea-detail` | "Tell me in your own words, in detail, what this idea is — what problem it solves, how you picture it working step by step, and anything you've tried or seen that makes you think it's possible. Take as long as you need." · Then structure what was said into problem, users, main flow, entities/data and integrations, without inventing choices; use it as the starting point for the rest of the interview. |
| `project-type` | "What kind of thing is this — software, a marketing or content project, an operations/process project, a research project, or something else?" · For software, also the concrete form: mobile app (iOS/Android/both), web app, desktop app, backend service/API, CLI, library, or a combination. "An app" alone is not an answer — ask which. |
| `goal` | Drafted by the agent from `idea-detail` and `project-type` as a short statement with context (what it is, for whom, what it achieves), then shown: "Is this the goal, or would you change it?" Covered only on the user's yes or edit. |
| `audience` | "Who or what is this for?" |
| `mvp` | "What's the MVP, or first phase, you want to reach?" · "What's explicitly *not* in the first phase?" |
| `done-when` | "How will you know the whole thing is finished? What's observably true then?" |
| `constraints-hard` | "Any hard constraints — deadline, budget, a platform or vendor you must use, a rule you can't break?" |
| `stakeholders` | "Does anyone else need to review or approve work as it goes?" |
| `automatability` | "Which parts of this do you expect an agent to do unattended, and which do you want to keep in your own hands?" — drives the `Owner` column in `tasks.md` |

## Phase B — Technologies, architecture & tools

Ask the block matching `project-type`. Answers go to `planning/architecture.md` as a
decision register (one row per decision: what, why, when decided).

### B-software

| Dimension | Questions |
|---|---|
| `runtime` | "What language and runtime version?" |
| `framework` | "Which framework(s) and key libraries? Anything you specifically *don't* want used?" |
| `toolchain` | "Package manager, test runner, formatter/linter — and the exact commands to run each?" |
| `datastore` | "Where does data live? Which database, and how are schema changes managed?" |
| `data-model` | "What are the main entities and how do they relate?" |
| `interface` | "What's the interface — REST, GraphQL, RPC, CLI, library API? Any versioning rule?" |
| `identity` | "How do users authenticate, and how is authorization decided?" |
| `hosting` | "Where does this run in production, and how does it get there?" |
| `ci` | "What has to pass before a change is acceptable?" |
| `env-secrets` | "How are configuration and secrets handled? What must never be committed?" |
| `verification` | "How do you want changes verified — unit tests, integration, manual, a smoke script?" |
| `third-party` | "Any third-party services or accounts this depends on?" |
| `observability` | "How would you find out this broke in production?" |

### B-marketing-content

| Dimension | Questions |
|---|---|
| `channels` | "Which channels — site, email, social, paid, events, press? Which matter most?" |
| `positioning` | "What's the core message, and who are you positioning against?" |
| `assets` | "What assets does this need — copy, design, video, landing pages — and who makes each?" |
| `tools` | "Which tools/platforms are you working in (CMS, ESP, analytics, scheduler, ad manager)?" |
| `data-sources` | "Where does the data for measurement come from, and who has access?" |
| `measurement` | "What metric decides whether this worked, and what's the target?" |
| `calendar` | "Any fixed dates — launch, campaign window, event, embargo?" |
| `approvals` | "Who signs off on published material, and what can't go out without review?" |
| `compliance` | "Any legal, brand or regulatory constraints on what you can claim or publish?" |

### B-operations-process

| Dimension | Questions |
|---|---|
| `current-state` | "How does this get done today, step by step?" |
| `systems` | "Which systems are involved, and which can be accessed programmatically?" |
| `volume-cadence` | "How often does this run, and at what volume?" |
| `failure-cost` | "What happens if a step is done wrong or skipped? What's unrecoverable?" |
| `handoffs` | "Where does work pass between people or teams?" |
| `access` | "What credentials or permissions are needed, and who grants them?" |

### B-research

| Dimension | Questions |
|---|---|
| `question` | "What's the actual question being answered?" |
| `sources` | "What sources or datasets are in scope? Which are off-limits?" |
| `method` | "How will you analyse it, and what would falsify the conclusion?" |
| `output-form` | "What's the deliverable — a report, a dataset, a model, a decision?" |
| `rigour` | "What standard does this need to meet, and who's the audience for it?" |

### B-other

Ask the generic set: `tools`, `inputs`, `outputs`, `who-does-what`, `sequence-constraints`,
`quality-bar`. Derive further dimensions from the goal statement — this branch exists so
an unanticipated project type is interviewed properly rather than forced into B-software.

## Phase C — Helper skills & agent tooling

| Dimension | Questions |
|---|---|
| `helper-skills` | Given the Phase B answers, name the skills/plugins available in this session (other than specloop) that would help the loop's worker agents here. Ask which, if any, to install. **Never install without explicit confirmation.** If no install mechanism resolves, print manual instructions instead of guessing a command. |
| `worker-cli` | "Which provider(s) might ever run this loop — `claude`, `codex`, `opencode`, `copilot`, `cursor-agent`, `agy`, or something else? List every one you might use, even from a different machine or harness later." The loop always picks whichever entry matches the session actually running it, and never splits work across the rest within one run — more than one entry is for portability and as an explicit fallback list, not for load-splitting. **Never ask for the headless/non-interactive flag of a known CLI — it's a fixed fact of that CLI, not a preference.** Use the known-flags map in `skills/loop-setup/SKILL.md` (Phase 1, step 1) and only fall back to asking when the CLI isn't in it. For an unrecognized CLI, ask "what's its headless/non-interactive flag?" Mention plainly: `specloop:loop` prefers its own harness's native sub-agent mechanism over any CLI when the matched entry's provider is available natively — the flag only drives the fallback case (no native mechanism, or an explicit user-directed switch to a different provider). |
| `agent-rules` | "Any rule you want every agent working in this repo to follow, or anything you want them never to do?" |

## Phase D — Styles & preferences

Gate on `visual-surface` first; skip the visual rows for a project with no visual output.

| Dimension | Questions |
|---|---|
| `visual-surface` | "Does this project have a visual surface — a UI, a site, a deck, brand artefacts?" |
| `palette` | "Any colors you want used, or an existing brand to match? Anything to avoid?" |
| `typography` | "Any typeface or type-scale preference?" |
| `density-mode` | "Dense or spacious? Light, dark, or both?" |
| `brand-refs` | "Any existing brand assets, or reference sites/products whose look you want?" |
| `tone` | "What tone should the writing take, and in which language?" |
| `accessibility` | "Any accessibility target, or devices/browsers that must work?" |
| `code-conventions` | "Naming, file layout, comment density, commit-message style — anything you want enforced?" |
| `anti-preferences` | "Anything you actively dislike and don't want to see?" |
| `preference-strength` | For each preference: "is that a hard rule or a default an agent may deviate from with reason?" |

## Phase E — Per-spec requirements

Asked once per spec, in roadmap order.

| Dimension | Questions |
|---|---|
| `what` | "What's being built in this spec?" |
| `serves` | "Who or what does it serve?" |
| `constraints` | "Hard constraints specific to this spec?" |
| `acceptance` | "How will you tell this spec is done? Give 2–5 things that must be observably true." |
| `out-of-scope` | "What's explicitly *not* in this spec?" |
| `dependencies` | "Does this need anything from another spec that the roadmap doesn't already record?" |
| `owner-split` | "Any task here that you want to do yourself rather than have an agent do?" |

## Phase F — Closing sweep

Run at the end of every phase above. Not optional, and not a formality.

1. Re-read what was just written. For every noun the user named but never specified
   ("the dashboard", "the integration", "the brand guidelines"), ask about it.
2. List the dimensions still `open` for this phase and ask about each one.
3. Ask: **"What haven't we covered that matters here?"**
4. If steps 1–3 produced anything new, write it down and run the sweep again — there's
   more to ask about.
5. The phase ends as soon as a full sweep produces nothing new. One clean pass is
   enough; don't repeat the question once the user has already said there's nothing
   more.

## Help-me-decide protocol (`016`)

Runs whenever the user answers a dimension with genuine uncertainty ("no sé", "not
sure", "I don't know" — any phase, not gated to a specific command). Judge which kind
of dimension it is before doing anything else:

**Researchable** — a technical or stylistic choice with real current best-practice
options: `runtime`, `framework`, `toolchain`, `datastore`, `hosting`, `palette`,
`typography`, `brand-refs`, and their equivalents in other project-type branches.
Search for current, fitting options (a web-search tool if the session has one) and
present 3–5 ranked options with a one-line reason each, tailored to what's already
been answered (goal, constraints, audience). No web-search tool available? Say so
explicitly and offer options from your own knowledge instead — never pass a guess
off as researched.

**Not researchable** — a fact about the user's own project or business, not
something the web has an opinion on: `audience`, `stakeholders`, `mvp`, `goal`, and
their equivalents. Say a generic search wouldn't help, and ask a narrower follow-up
question instead of manufacturing an options list.

Either way: the user picks one, asks for more, or leaves the dimension `open` — never
infer a choice to close it. Record the final answer `covered` in
`.specloop/interview.md` with a note that it was resolved via researched options, so
it stays distinguishable from an answer the user reached on their own.
